# Effect of *APOE* Alleles on the Glial Transcriptome in Normal Aging and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
We investigated the differential effects of *APOE* alleles on the microglia and astrocyte transcriptome in the absence and presence of neuritic plaques (NPs) using bulk brain RNA-seq data from two large brain-banks and performed follow-on experiments in *APOE* knock-in mice.
