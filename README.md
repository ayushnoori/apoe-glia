# About
> ### Effect of *APOE* Alleles on the Glial Transcriptome in Normal Aging and Alzheimer's Disease
> We investigated the differential effects of *APOE* alleles on the microglia and astrocyte transcriptome in the absence and presence of neuritic plaques (NPs) using bulk brain RNA-seq data from two large brain banks and performed follow-on experiments in *APOE* knock-in mice.
